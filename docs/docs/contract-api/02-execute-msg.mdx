# `ExecuteMsg`

The `ExecuteMsg` is the message that is used to interact with the `cw-ica-controller` contract mainly by the owner.

## CreateChannel

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.4.0/src/types/msg.rs#L27-L37
```

This message is used to initiate an ICS-27 channel open handshake. It is only callable by the owner.
This message only takes one optional parameter: `channel_open_init_options`.

If this parameter is left empty, then the contract will use the `channel_open_init_options` that were last
passed to the `InstantiateMsg` or `CreateChannel` messages.

If this parameter is set, then the contract will use the `channel_open_init_options` that are passed to this
message and save them for future `CreateChannel` messages.
